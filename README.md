# Bioinformatics Projects

1. Needleman Wunsch Project

This project identifies the closest CoV spike protein sequence alignments of the following species: Avian, Bat, Bovine, Canine, and Human using the Needleman Wunsch algorithm and the BLOSUM 62 scoring matrix.

2. HMM and Viterbi Project

This project aims to understand how similar or dissimilar the TNF gene is across humans and primates, and whether other mammals have a similar genetic disposition to humans and primates. A total of 50 TNF sequences was obtained, 25 of which will be primates, and the other 25 of which will be mammals from other taxa. A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was built to infer the presence of ancestral relationships between the sequences. A phylogenetic tree was also be drawn to visually represent the evolutionary relationships among the species analyzed. Furthermore, these sequences will be trained through a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that then later computes a log-Viterbi score. These analyses will help determine the similarity between the species among the primate clade and mammals from other taxa.
